Not only is the food fire, but it's also cheap and quick as well. Kebab has its origins in the middle east. When some people think of kebab, they think of <a href="http://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Beef-Shish-Kabob-Recipe-6.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">shish kebabs</a> which are meat skewers. The kebabtallriks in Sweden are made from a variant called <a href="https://i2.wp.com/theheritagecook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Turkish-Doner-Lamb-Kebab2-iStock.jpg?resize=499%2C750" rel="noopener" target="_blank">DÃ¶ner kebab</a>. This is a Turkish flair, with the kebabs being cooked on a vertical rotisserie with the outer layer sliced vertically into thin shavings as it cooks. Tallrik means plate in english, so kebabtallrik just means a kebab plate. It consists of three main things: kebab, french fries, and a side of vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc. In order to maximize the value of kebabtallriks, we want to minimize the cost per gram because they are inversely proportional. I brought along a scale to each of these kebab stands and measured the mass of each kebabtallrik. Having studied chemistry and physics during high school and Uni, I made sure to zero the scale before measuring the <a href="https://youtu.be/MfIWsXZRaIs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">product</a> by asking each kebab stand to provide me with an empty styrofoam plate. Sure there are other sources of error that affect the cost per gram like too much <a href="https://youtu.be/SLsTskih7_I" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sauce</a> would increase the value of the kebabtallrik artificially, but I tried to minimize these the best I could.

Coming from California, I used to frequent this joint called Chipotle. It consists of a trifecta of Mexican food, quality ingredients like perfectly charred medium-rare steak, delicious corn, Pico de Gallo (MILD if you never had authentic Mexican food), and the fast food-esqueness of McDonalds. In my eyes, Chipotle is the holy grail of value, but there are certain procedures that you must follow like getting two halves of meat, i.e half chicken, half steak, in order to reap the full benefits of value. But this is an entire editorial in of itself. So when I came to Sweden to study abroad at Lund University, I had to find a replacement for Chipotle. The replacement came to be kebabtallrik. I still think Chipotle is tastier, but kebabtallrik satisfies most of the criteria: the flavors are good, it has the fast food-esqueness from McDonalds and for the price to food ratio, it provides a good value. I analyzed five main kebab joints throughout Lund. Here are my observations:

<h1>DELPHI PIZZERIA </h1>
<h3>Cost: 78 SEK</h3>
<h3>Weight: 783 g</h3>
<h3>Cost per gram: 0.0996  ( 3 significant figures* ) </h3> 
*If you forgot your <a href="https://youtu.be/sIs501ktFfQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">chemistry</a>, here's a quick refresher on <a href="https://youtu.be/eCJ76hz7jPM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sig Figs</a>. 

This place is a godsend if you live in Delphi. So Delphi is one of the major student accommodations in Lund, in addition to Sparta, Parentesen, PÃ¥lsjÃ¶Ã¤ng, and a few more. I lived here only during summer, but from winter until spring, I would still bike up a couple of times every week to kick it with my buddies who lived here. Biking is one of the greatest things about being a student in Lund. Not only is the city of Lund incredibly bikeable with no massive mountains like San Francisco or Lisbon, but you can get anywhere in Lund within 20 minutes by bike. There are a good amount of parties in Lund and what would be hella fun would be to assemble your squadron, <a href="https://youtu.be/lxZyM3smDig" rel="noopener" target="_blank">form vultron!!</a>, and then mob to the festivities by bike. 

Another thing that's interesting to me is the drunk biking in Lund. It's not actively encouraged but they definitely inadvertently encourage it. Like if you show up to a bar or club a little too drunk, the bouncers at the door don't let you in. So you have to leave and drunk bike to the next destination. (I assume most students especially internationals bike everywhere, but I do know a few that had no bikes and just bused.) Regardless of not getting let in to bars or clubs, I know a couple of buddies that either chipped a tooth, fell in a bush and lost all their shit, or injured themselves biking back faded from house parties. You can injure yourself pretty bad but I'm going to come clean, biking drunk is exhilarating as hell. I like to live in the grey area between live fast die young and <a href="https://youtu.be/Iu1qa8N2ID0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">live long and prosper</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/ZKY8-c5CRgU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">biking</a> drunk is in this area for me. Please don't drink and drive though, that shit is <a href="http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140421145933-justin-bieber-mugshot-split-02-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">fucked</a>. 

So if you live in Delphi and you're hungovered, too lazy to cook, definitely come here. At a kronor to gram ratio of 0.0996, it's on the higher side, but the quality of the kebab you are getting is worth it.

<h1>LUNDAFALAFEL</h1>
<h3>Cost: 70 SEK</h3>
<h3>Weight: 876 g</h3>
<h3>Cost per gram: 0.0799 </h3> 

Lundafalafel is by far the undisputed champion of the king of value. With a cost per gram of 0.0799, it defeats the other kebabtallriks by a solid margin. Not only that, but with a central location right on Stora SÃ¶dergatan, it's convenient for everyone. I remember when I first got here to Lund in January. I was fucking freezing because I'm from California and I'm not used to the cold. I also didn't get my <a href="https://youtu.be/PFGGTPPNdRQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">wok</a> yet so I couldn't chef it up. At my studio flat, I only had skillets so I was eating fried eggs, salad, yogurt, cereal etc. Basically I was starving. Not on this <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/IMG_0005.JPG" rel="noopener" target="_blank">level</a>, but <a href="https://youtu.be/08ITsgiL6v8?t=9m35s" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first world hunger</a>. Swedes I talked to were saying kebab is the shit here and you got to check out this place called Lundafalafel. So I went and was happy for a couple of hours because I was cured briefly of first world hunger.

The only issue I have with this place is that it's cash only and I never carry cash. My everyday carry is my phone, a money clip with seven cards, and keys. I carry no cash or coins for that matter. There have been numerous <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anne_Layne-Farrar/publication/24049742_The_Move_Toward_a_Cashless_Society_Calculating_the_Costs_and_Benefits/links/568a7da808ae1975839d8864.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studies</a> on why transitioning to a cashless society is better. For example, take grocery store transactions. Let's err on the safer side and say paying by card vs cash saves 5 seconds per transaction on average. In the USA in 2017, individuals make on average 1.5 grocery trips per week, meaning 78 trips per year (<a href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/251728/weekly-number-of-us-grocery-shopping-trips-per-household/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source</a>). With an average savings of 5 seconds per transaction, each individual saves 390 seconds ( 6 and a half minutes). That might sound like nothing for an individual; we spend more time on Facebook each day (<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html?mcubz=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source</a>). But if you take into account the US population size of 323.1 million and 77.2%, the percentage of people over 18, (rough estimate of how many people do their own grocery shopping, <a href="https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source</a>), we get 249.5 million people. So each year the US population wastes ~97,309 million seconds => 27 million hours. According to statistics, the average American makes $23.86 per hour, so America could potentially save $644.22 million per year if we all transitioned to a cash less society (<a href="https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">source</a>) (If my math is wrong, <a href="mailto:yxing@berkeley.edu" rel="noopener" target="_blank">call me out</a>). The transition to Apple Pay is another step forward; instead of carrying around numerous cards all we need to carry around is a phone. It's not without it's flaws, but it is another further streamline of payments.

However, I think the real future of cashless society is with QR codes. In restaurants in China, you could scan a restaurant's QR code, enter the amount of the bill and pay. The two technologies behind this are called Alipay and WeChat wallet. I've personally seen this in use when I was in Beijing in February and it's fire. <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/58fa1f5ce4b086ce58981009" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Beggars on the street</a> have QR codes on their signs instead of cans. There's no handing over of cards or cash; the client and the restaurant both deal with their own smartphones and each gets a notification when it's finished. This needs to be the future in Western countries including Sweden and the USA.

<h1>SIBYLLA</h1>
<h3>Cost: 75 SEK</h3>
<h3>Weight: 330 g</h3>
<h3>Cost per gram: 0.227 </h3>

At the highest price per gram, Sibylla's kebabtallrik provides the least amount of value. However, the quality of the meat is much higher than other joints. The kebab is thicker and the meat is tastier than all the other kebabtallrik's sampled. This could be partly to the fact that Sibylla is a chain of fast food restaurants around Sweden and Finland. With a corporate supply chain, the quality of the meat would most likely be higher and also standardized across locations. They serve other traditional Swedish food also like grillad korv med brÃ¶d (a grilled sausage in a bun) and kÃ¶ttbullar med mos och lingon (meatballs with mashed potatoes and lingonberries).

I fuck with multinational corporations especially in the realm of food. I'm not going to lie, I love McDonalds. I don't eat it every week, not even every month, but I can go into almost any country in the world and go into a McDonalds and it will taste 99% the same. Sure there are exceptions like India but McDonalds is pretty standardized and the <a href="https://goo.gl/KK6xmT" rel="noopener" target="_blank">golden arches</a> are incredibly iconic. I remember reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0547750331" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fast Food Nation</a> in 7th grade in Ms. Orlando's class, and the book quoted a statistic saying the golden arches are now more recognized than the Christian cross. I can go into any country, go into one of the golden arches and it will remind me back home of America. I'm happy for Sibylla that it reached this level. All the other kebab joints in this editorial are local to Lund, but Sibylla is a nationwide chain. I could be in GÃ¶teborg or Stockholm or another Swedish city, and get the Sibylla's flair of kebabtallrik and know exactly what I would be getting. Sibylla has ~170 locations in Sweden which all standardized the Sibylla kebabtallrik taste. However, in terms of making me full, it just didn't cut it. Still tasty though.

<h1>PIZZERIA KRYDDAN</h1>
<h3>Cost: 79 SEK</h3>
<h3>Weight: 737 g</h3>
<h3>Cost per gram: 0.107 </h3>

0.107 SEK/g is respectable. Kryddan is the last name of two brothers and run by them. Both are co-owners of Pizzeria Kryddan; one of which appears in my pictures. It's super close to Parentesen which is home to the annual <a href="https://youtu.be/_r1ejul4p8Y" rel="noopener" target="_blank">BrÃ¤nnboll tournament</a>. During the tournament, Parentesen corridors become teams, each fighting  to not become the last place, otherwise they would be responsible for cleaning up the mess that follows. 

To understand the debauchery of this tournament, we have to understand the architecture of Parentesen. Parentesen is called like so because it looks like a pair of <a href="https://www.sydsvenskan.se/images/KzwjOcsu1C5o7qeklcgVS_J88AM.jpg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">parentheses</a>, with the space enveloped between them occupied by a field. Each corridor above the ground has a balcony directly facing the field and with two balconies per floor per parenthesis, there are a total of 12 balconies facing the field. During the tournament all the other corridors are watching from these balconies. Honestly I got to hand it to the architects of Parentesen. They made a modern day Roman Colosseum inside this student town of Lund. The BrÃ¤nnboll tournament is the equivalent of a Roman gladiator fight. There's no humans murdered or lions being slayed, but once the final game takes place and the absolute loser of the entire tournament is determined, everyone from all the 12 balconies just start throwing all their trash onto the field below. When I mean trash, I don't just mean the trash from this week's recycling or trash bin. The residents of Parentesen start hoarding trash weeks or months in advance, just so when the absolute loser is determined, they can throw off all their rubbish onto the field and the losers would have to clean it up. Rules are rules!

So I didn't witness the game at all, but I was in Parentesen at night after all the debauchery had taken place. Here's my <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/j5a74vgad3f8arn/Parentesen.mp4?dl=0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">snap</a> from the night. As you can tell, Parentesen becomes a huge garbage dump, and the losers spend the next day cleaning up.

<h1>Olympia Pizza &amp; CafÃ©</h1>
<h3>Cost: 80 SEK</h3>
<h3>Weight: 557 g </h3>
<h3>Cost per gram: 0.144 </h3>

This joint is right outside the doors of Sparta, another Lund student accommodation. Honestly, after writing about all these kebab stands, I realized that distance plays a huge factor in deducing value. Distance traveled isn't a big deal but the time it takes is, and so by the transitive property, we got to take into account the distance traveled to food consumption ratio. If you live in Sparta, just come by here. With 0.144 SEK/g it's on the higher side, but the time saved is worth it, especially if you order in advance. 

Sparta has some of the best corridor parties, but according to this <a href="http://mokudekiru.com/2011/02/lund-party-culture-part-3-korridor-parties-and-pre-parties/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">blog</a> and what I've seen, "people must bring their own drinks to all pre-parties, korridor parties, etc (basically, anything that isnât a nation)." This is hella funny to me because this goes back to most Swedes being hoarders of alcohol. According to <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=bzfEo6E-YuUC&pg=PA168&lpg=PA168&dq=swedish+workers+alcohol+problem&source=bl&ots=5vt0_DAwPr&sig=CsZ7c6-zK3P7opl-yuZS3wqAjxo&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwj9-LOY6cTWAhUpjVQKHWAcDu8Q6AEIYzAM#v=onepage&q=swedish%20workers%20alcohol%20problem&f=false" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sweden: An Illustrated History</a>, a hypothesis to why Swedes are such heavy social drinkers / binge drinkers is because of weather. With long and cold winters where people drink to stay warm or stayed inside to drink when there was nothing else to do, Swedes have a natural affinity for alcohol. Another hypothesis could be the discovery of the potato. In 1746, it was discovered that the potato was excellent for distilling and with the potato growing in abundance, alcohol was made readily available to the poorer farming population. Regardless of the origins, Sweden has a government alcohol monopoly called Systembolaget for the sale on all beverages stronger than 3.5% by volume. Not only were there only two Systembolagets in the entirety of Lund, but also the prices were hella jacked up. It is no wonder that when my good Swedish buddy came back from Spain, he brought a suitcase stuffed with alcohol back with him.

Here in the states, we don't have that problem because if you want alcohol, just go to Costco and buy multiple <a href="http://dev.yumm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bilde.jpeg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">handles</a>. We have other problems like the huge grey area between 18 and 21 when students go to Uni and when students are legally allowed to drink, but that's a whole different discussion. Another interesting observation is that Systembolaget is closed on Sundays and only open until 15.00 on Saturdays. So you either got to hoard alcohol, be meticulous in your planning of the weekend, or spend money drinking out at bars or clubs. All of which are perfectly fine options, but for me I emphasize value and so I would be a hoarder anyday.

<h3>Conclusion: </h3>

With a sample size of one for each kebab shop, there is some random error that needs to be eliminated. The best way would be to order five kebabtallriks from each kebab stand and average them. <a href="https://youtu.be/VmOd27UwTsg">It's the only way to be sure</a>. In addition to random error, there are some systematic errors that could have occurred within measurements. Here are some potential sources of error.

Kebabtallrik is made up of three primary things. <a href="https://youtu.be/3pbjuDY3xGo">KEBAB</a>, french fries, and some vegetables, namely lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, peppers, etc. When we measure the weight of a kebabtallrik we want to maximize the weight of the kebab because that's the most expensive part of the meal. Too many fries will significantly impact the cost per gram of the kebabtallrik by deflating it.

In addition, there are some workers that are gods at making kebabtallrik while some are just being trained. By going to the the kebab stand at different times per day would minimize random error. Personally, I befriended a bro who worked at this one particular kebab shop who would plug it super fat. At that particular time in my life I would be getting two wraps, one falafel and one shawarma and a coke for like 70 kronors. It was a fucking good deal. Unfortunately he doesn't work there anymore so I went back to getting the tried and true, KEBABTALLRIK. 

Lastly, I only did five of the most frequented kebab shops for me. There are another twenty in Lund at least. This shit is so fucking fire and popular that they got every single block and neighborhood of Lund covered. Honestly, as a human being your time is the most valuable thing. Beyonce, Floyd Mayweather, Elon Musk, Kanye have 24 hours in a day. Everyone on this planet is given the same 24 hours in the day. The question is: what do you choose to do with yours? What separates us is how we choose to use that time. So at the end of the day, if you're trying to crank out a problem set and you live in Delphi, go to Dephi Pizzeria. The time spent commuting can be better utilized and the value achieved has decreasing marginal utility.

I am unfortunately not in Lund at this particular point in my life, but if you are and want to carry on the torch please contact me. Here is what I have planned the next time I'm back!

Not only is the food fire, but it's also cheap and quick as well. Kebab has its origins in the middle east. When some people think of kebab, they think of \u003ca href=\"http://www.themediterraneandish.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Beef-Shish-Kabob-Recipe-6.jpg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eshish kebabs\u003c/a\u003e which are meat skewers. The kebabtallriks in Sweden are made from a variant called \u003ca href=\"https://i2.wp.com/theheritagecook.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/Turkish-Doner-Lamb-Kebab2-iStock.jpg?resize=499%2C750\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eDÃ¶ner kebab\u003c/a\u003e. This is a Turkish flair, with the kebabs being cooked on a vertical rotisserie with the outer layer sliced vertically into thin shavings as it cooks. Tallrik means plate in english, so kebabtallrik just means a kebab plate. It consists of three main things: kebab, french fries, and a side of vegetables such as lettuce, tomatoes, onions, peppers, etc. In order to maximize the value of kebabtallriks, we want to minimize the cost per gram because they are inversely proportional. I brought along a scale to each of these kebab stands and measured the mass of each kebabtallrik. Having studied chemistry and physics during high school and Uni, I made sure to zero the scale before measuring the \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/MfIWsXZRaIs\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eproduct\u003c/a\u003e by asking each kebab stand to provide me with an empty styrofoam plate. Sure there are other sources of error that affect the cost per gram like too much \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/SLsTskih7_I\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esauce\u003c/a\u003e would increase the value of the kebabtallrik artificially, but I tried to minimize these the best I could.\n\nComing from California, I used to frequent this joint called Chipotle. It consists of a trifecta of Mexican food, quality ingredients like perfectly charred medium-rare steak, delicious corn, Pico de Gallo (MILD if you never had authentic Mexican food), and the fast food-esqueness of McDonalds. In my eyes, Chipotle is the holy grail of value, but there are certain procedures that you must follow like getting two halves of meat, i.e half chicken, half steak, in order to reap the full benefits of value. But this is an entire editorial in of itself. So when I came to Sweden to study abroad at Lund University, I had to find a replacement for Chipotle. The replacement came to be kebabtallrik. I still think Chipotle is tastier, but kebabtallrik satisfies most of the criteria: the flavors are good, it has the fast food-esqueness from McDonalds and for the price to food ratio, it provides a good value. I analyzed five main kebab joints throughout Lund. Here are my observations:\n\n\u003ch1\u003eDELPHI PIZZERIA \u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost: 78 SEK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeight: 783 g\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost per gram: 0.0996  ( 3 significant figures* ) \u003c/h3\u003e \n*If you forgot your \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/sIs501ktFfQ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003echemistry\u003c/a\u003e, here's a quick refresher on \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/eCJ76hz7jPM\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eSig Figs\u003c/a\u003e. \n\nThis place is a godsend if you live in Delphi. So Delphi is one of the major student accommodations in Lund, in addition to Sparta, Parentesen, PÃ¥lsjÃ¶Ã¤ng, and a few more. I lived here only during summer, but from winter until spring, I would still bike up a couple of times every week to kick it with my buddies who lived here. Biking is one of the greatest things about being a student in Lund. Not only is the city of Lund incredibly bikeable with no massive mountains like San Francisco or Lisbon, but you can get anywhere in Lund within 20 minutes by bike. There are a good amount of parties in Lund and what would be hella fun would be to assemble your squadron, \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/lxZyM3smDig\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eform vultron!!\u003c/a\u003e, and then mob to the festivities by bike. \n\nAnother thing that's interesting to me is the drunk biking in Lund. It's not actively encouraged but they definitely inadvertently encourage it. Like if you show up to a bar or club a little too drunk, the bouncers at the door don't let you in. So you have to leave and drunk bike to the next destination. (I assume most students especially internationals bike everywhere, but I do know a few that had no bikes and just bused.) Regardless of not getting let in to bars or clubs, I know a couple of buddies that either chipped a tooth, fell in a bush and lost all their shit, or injured themselves biking back faded from house parties. You can injure yourself pretty bad but I'm going to come clean, biking drunk is exhilarating as hell. I like to live in the grey area between live fast die young and \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/Iu1qa8N2ID0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elive long and prosper\u003c/a\u003e and \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/ZKY8-c5CRgU\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ebiking\u003c/a\u003e drunk is in this area for me. Please don't drink and drive though, that shit is \u003ca href=\"http://i2.cdn.cnn.com/cnnnext/dam/assets/140421145933-justin-bieber-mugshot-split-02-horizontal-large-gallery.jpg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efucked\u003c/a\u003e. \n\nSo if you live in Delphi and you're hungovered, too lazy to cook, definitely come here. At a kronor to gram ratio of 0.0996, it's on the higher side, but the quality of the kebab you are getting is worth it. \n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-5.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-6.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch1\u003eLUNDAFALAFEL\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost: 70 SEK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeight: 876 g\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost per gram: 0.0799 \u003c/h3\u003e \n\nLundafalafel is by far the undisputed champion of the king of value. With a cost per gram of 0.0799, it defeats the other kebabtallriks by a solid margin. Not only that, but with a central location right on Stora SÃ¶dergatan, it's convenient for everyone. I remember when I first got here to Lund in January. I was fucking freezing because I'm from California and I'm not used to the cold. I also didn't get my \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/PFGGTPPNdRQ\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ewok\u003c/a\u003e yet so I couldn't chef it up. At my studio flat, I only had skillets so I was eating fried eggs, salad, yogurt, cereal etc. Basically I was starving. Not on this \u003ca href=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/IMG_0005.JPG\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003elevel\u003c/a\u003e, but \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/08ITsgiL6v8?t=9m35s\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003efirst world hunger\u003c/a\u003e. Swedes I talked to were saying kebab is the shit here and you got to check out this place called Lundafalafel. So I went and was happy for a couple of hours because I was cured briefly of first world hunger.\n\nThe only issue I have with this place is that it's cash only and I never carry cash. My everyday carry is my phone, a money clip with seven cards, and keys. I carry no cash or coins for that matter. There have been numerous \u003ca href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anne_Layne-Farrar/publication/24049742_The_Move_Toward_a_Cashless_Society_Calculating_the_Costs_and_Benefits/links/568a7da808ae1975839d8864.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003estudies\u003c/a\u003e on why transitioning to a cashless society is better. For example, take grocery store transactions. Let's err on the safer side and say paying by card vs cash saves 5 seconds per transaction on average. In the USA in 2017, individuals make on average 1.5 grocery trips per week, meaning 78 trips per year (\u003ca href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/251728/weekly-number-of-us-grocery-shopping-trips-per-household/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e). With an average savings of 5 seconds per transaction, each individual saves 390 seconds ( 6 and a half minutes). That might sound like nothing for an individual; we spend more time on Facebook each day (\u003ca href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/06/business/facebook-bends-the-rules-of-audience-engagement-to-its-advantage.html?mcubz=1\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e). But if you take into account the US population size of 323.1 million and 77.2%, the percentage of people over 18, (rough estimate of how many people do their own grocery shopping, \u003ca href=\"https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/US/PST045216\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e), we get 249.5 million people. So each year the US population wastes ~97,309 million seconds =\u003e 27 million hours. According to statistics, the average American makes $23.86 per hour, so America could potentially save $644.22 million per year if we all transitioned to a cash less society (\u003ca href=\"https://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes_nat.htm#00-0000\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esource\u003c/a\u003e) (If my math is wrong, \u003ca href=\"mailto:yxing@berkeley.edu\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ecall me out\u003c/a\u003e). The transition to Apple Pay is another step forward; instead of carrying around numerous cards all we need to carry around is a phone. It's not without it's flaws, but it is another further streamline of payments.\n\nHowever, I think the real future of cashless society is with QR codes. In restaurants in China, you could scan a restaurant's QR code, enter the amount of the bill and pay. The two technologies behind this are called Alipay and WeChat wallet. I've personally seen this in use when I was in Beijing in February and it's fire. \u003ca href=\"http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/58fa1f5ce4b086ce58981009\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBeggars on the street\u003c/a\u003e have QR codes on their signs instead of cans. There's no handing over of cards or cash; the client and the restaurant both deal with their own smartphones and each gets a notification when it's finished. This needs to be the future in Western countries including Sweden and the USA.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-8.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-18.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-19.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch1\u003eSIBYLLA\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost: 75 SEK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeight: 330 g\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost per gram: 0.227 \u003c/h3\u003e\n\nAt the highest price per gram, Sibylla's kebabtallrik provides the least amount of value. However, the quality of the meat is much higher than other joints. The kebab is thicker and the meat is tastier than all the other kebabtallrik's sampled. This could be partly to the fact that Sibylla is a chain of fast food restaurants around Sweden and Finland. With a corporate supply chain, the quality of the meat would most likely be higher and also standardized across locations. They serve other traditional Swedish food also like grillad korv med brÃ¶d (a grilled sausage in a bun) and kÃ¶ttbullar med mos och lingon (meatballs with mashed potatoes and lingonberries).\n\nI fuck with multinational corporations especially in the realm of food. I'm not going to lie, I love McDonalds. I don't eat it every week, not even every month, but I can go into almost any country in the world and go into a McDonalds and it will taste 99% the same. Sure there are exceptions like India but McDonalds is pretty standardized and the \u003ca href=\"https://goo.gl/KK6xmT\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003egolden arches\u003c/a\u003e are incredibly iconic. I remember reading \u003ca href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Fast-Food-Nation-Dark-All-American/dp/0547750331\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eFast Food Nation\u003c/a\u003e in 7th grade in Ms. Orlando's class, and the book quoted a statistic saying the golden arches are now more recognized than the Christian cross. I can go into any country, go into one of the golden arches and it will remind me back home of America. I'm happy for Sibylla that it reached this level. All the other kebab joints in this editorial are local to Lund, but Sibylla is a nationwide chain. I could be in GÃ¶teborg or Stockholm or another Swedish city, and get the Sibylla's flair of kebabtallrik and know exactly what I would be getting. Sibylla has ~170 locations in Sweden which all standardized the Sibylla kebabtallrik taste. However, in terms of making me full, it just didn't cut it. Still tasty though. \n \n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-13.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-14.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003ePIZZERIA KRYDDAN\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost: 79 SEK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeight: 737 g\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost per gram: 0.107 \u003c/h3\u003e\n\n0.107 SEK/g is respectable. Kryddan is the last name of two brothers and run by them. Both are co-owners of Pizzeria Kryddan; one of which appears in my pictures. It's super close to Parentesen which is home to the annual \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/_r1ejul4p8Y\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eBrÃ¤nnboll tournament\u003c/a\u003e. During the tournament, Parentesen corridors become teams, each fighting  to not become the last place, otherwise they would be responsible for cleaning up the mess that follows. \n\nTo understand the debauchery of this tournament, we have to understand the architecture of Parentesen. Parentesen is called like so because it looks like a pair of \u003ca href=\"https://www.sydsvenskan.se/images/KzwjOcsu1C5o7qeklcgVS_J88AM.jpg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eparentheses\u003c/a\u003e, with the space enveloped between them occupied by a field. Each corridor above the ground has a balcony directly facing the field and with two balconies per floor per parenthesis, there are a total of 12 balconies facing the field. During the tournament all the other corridors are watching from these balconies. Honestly I got to hand it to the architects of Parentesen. They made a modern day Roman Colosseum inside this student town of Lund. The BrÃ¤nnboll tournament is the equivalent of a Roman gladiator fight. There's no humans murdered or lions being slayed, but once the final game takes place and the absolute loser of the entire tournament is determined, everyone from all the 12 balconies just start throwing all their trash onto the field below. When I mean trash, I don't just mean the trash from this week's recycling or trash bin. The residents of Parentesen start hoarding trash weeks or months in advance, just so when the absolute loser is determined, they can throw off all their rubbish onto the field and the losers would have to clean it up. Rules are rules!\n\nSo I didn't witness the game at all, but I was in Parentesen at night after all the debauchery had taken place. Here's my \u003ca href=\"https://www.dropbox.com/s/j5a74vgad3f8arn/Parentesen.mp4?dl=0\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003esnap\u003c/a\u003e from the night. As you can tell, Parentesen becomes a huge garbage dump, and the losers spend the next day cleaning up.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-17.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-16.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-15.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eOlympia Pizza \u0026amp; CafÃ©\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost: 80 SEK\u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eWeight: 557 g \u003c/h3\u003e\n\u003ch3\u003eCost per gram: 0.144 \u003c/h3\u003e\n\nThis joint is right outside the doors of Sparta, another Lund student accommodation. Honestly, after writing about all these kebab stands, I realized that distance plays a huge factor in deducing value. Distance traveled isn't a big deal but the time it takes is, and so by the transitive property, we got to take into account the distance traveled to food consumption ratio. If you live in Sparta, just come by here. With 0.144 SEK/g it's on the higher side, but the time saved is worth it, especially if you order in advance. \n\nSparta has some of the best corridor parties, but according to this \u003ca href=\"http://mokudekiru.com/2011/02/lund-party-culture-part-3-korridor-parties-and-pre-parties/\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003eblog\u003c/a\u003e and what I've seen, \"people must bring their own drinks to all pre-parties, korridor parties, etc (basically, anything that isnât a nation).\" This is hella funny to me because this goes back to most Swedes being hoarders of alcohol.

Another hypothesis could be the discovery of the potato. In 1746, it was discovered that the potato was excellent for distilling and with the potato growing in abundance, alcohol was made readily available to the poorer farming population. Regardless of the origins, Sweden has a government alcohol monopoly called Systembolaget for the sale on all beverages stronger than 3.5% by volume. Not only were there only two Systembolagets in the entirety of Lund, but also the prices were hella jacked up. It is no wonder that when my good Swedish buddy came back from Spain, he brought a suitcase stuffed with alcohol back with him.\n\nHere in the states, we don't have that problem because if you want alcohol, just go to Costco and buy multiple \u003ca href=\"http://dev.yumm.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/bilde.jpeg\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\"\u003ehandles\u003c/a\u003e. We have other problems like the huge grey area between 18 and 21 when students go to Uni and when students are legally allowed to drink, but that's a whole different discussion. Another interesting observation is that Systembolaget is closed on Sundays and only open until 15.00 on Saturdays. So you either got to hoard alcohol, be meticulous in your planning of the weekend, or spend money drinking out at bars or clubs. All of which are perfectly fine options, but for me I emphasize value and so I would be a hoarder anyday.\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-21.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-22.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-23.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-25.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\u003ch3\u003eConclusion: \u003c/h3\u003e\n\nWith a sample size of one for each kebab shop, there is some random error that needs to be eliminated. The best way would be to order five kebabtallriks from each kebab stand and average them. \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/VmOd27UwTsg\"\u003eIt's the only way to be sure\u003c/a\u003e. In addition to random error, there are some systematic errors that could have occurred within measurements. Here are some potential sources of error.\n\nKebabtallrik is made up of three primary things. \u003ca href=\"https://youtu.be/3pbjuDY3xGo\"\u003eKEBAB\u003c/a\u003e, french fries, and some vegetables, namely lettuce, tomato, cucumber, onion, peppers, etc. When we measure the weight of a kebabtallrik we want to maximize the weight of the kebab because that's the most expensive part of the meal. Too many fries will significantly impact the cost per gram of the kebabtallrik by deflating it.\n\nIn addition, there are some workers that are gods at making kebabtallrik while some are just being trained. By going to the the kebab stand at different times per day would minimize random error. Personally, I befriended a bro who worked at this one particular kebab shop who would plug it super fat. At that particular time in my life I would be getting two wraps, one falafel and one shawarma and a coke for like 70 kronors. It was a fucking good deal. Unfortunately he doesn't work there anymore so I went back to getting the tried and true, KEBABTALLRIK. \n\nLastly, I only did five of the most frequented kebab shops for me. There are another twenty in Lund at least. This shit is so fucking fire and popular that they got every single block and neighborhood of Lund covered. Honestly, as a human being your time is the most valuable thing. Beyonce, Floyd Mayweather, Elon Musk, Kanye have 24 hours in a day. Everyone on this planet is given the same 24 hours in the day. The question is: what do you choose to do with yours? What separates us is how we choose to use that time. So at the end of the day, if you're trying to crank out a problem set and you live in Delphi, go to Dephi Pizzeria. The time spent commuting can be better utilized and the value achieved has decreasing marginal utility.\n\nI am unfortunately not in Lund at this particular point in my life, but if you are and want to carry on the torch please contact me. Here is what I have planned the next time I'm back! \n\n\u003ch1\u003eCOMING UP!@!@ \u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eSALEHAN EXPRESS\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-10.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eSOFIA GRILLER\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-20.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\u003ch1\u003eSESAM\u003c/h1\u003e\n\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-11.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-12.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\n\u003ch1\u003eKEBABHUSET \u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cimg src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/kebab-7.jpg\" alt=\"\" /\u003e\n\n\n\n","mainPhoto":{"mainPhoto":"https://storage.googleapis.com/dxing/imgs/kebabQuest2/KEBABCOVER-1.jpg"}}}],"includes":{"Asset":[{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3efe131fxlk7"}},"id":"1hr3ddVjd2UcqcqyESWiCy","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.299Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.299Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.03.46 AM","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/3efe131fxlk7/1hr3ddVjd2UcqcqyESWiCy/0e116044c4a31dfb225832b237f2466c/Screen_Shot_2017-11-18_at_7.03.46_AM.png","details":{"size":3643766,"image":{"width":2880,"height":1324}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.03.46 AM.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3efe131fxlk7"}},"id":"3259mmGj2wK2cy2iocEMOq","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.459Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.459Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.08.32 AM","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/3efe131fxlk7/3259mmGj2wK2cy2iocEMOq/e9a4144d5d5034ac0a55cade2d9daeea/Screen_Shot_2017-11-18_at_7.08.32_AM.png","details":{"size":423248,"image":{"width":2880,"height":1310}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.08.32 AM.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3efe131fxlk7"}},"id":"5JijNfOBZSEYsik0Om6m4G","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.444Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.444Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.05.04 AM","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/3efe131fxlk7/5JijNfOBZSEYsik0Om6m4G/a05904f219ca7b7adeea58ca91b9f46f/Screen_Shot_2017-11-18_at_7.05.04_AM.png","details":{"size":2356218,"image":{"width":2880,"height":1302}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.05.04 AM.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3efe131fxlk7"}},"id":"6PmKQhIwjS0I0YsC6EQ6qI","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.462Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.462Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.09.35 AM","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/3efe131fxlk7/6PmKQhIwjS0I0YsC6EQ6qI/062aa102cbdebd3a03a29409ee3fb693/Screen_Shot_2017-11-18_at_7.09.35_AM.png","details":{"size":2903458,"image":{"width":2880,"height":1318}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.09.35 AM.png","contentType":"image/png"}}},{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"3efe131fxlk7"}},"id":"NteO2KBGwwWO0wKka06AS","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.338Z","updatedAt":"2017-11-18T15:12:32.338Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.09.23 AM","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/3efe131fxlk7/NteO2KBGwwWO0wKka06AS/e6a60f06c6e1a93f65805f32614439ef/Screen_Shot_2017-11-18_at_7.09.23_AM.png","details":{"size":3102169,"image":{"width":2880,"height":1314}},"fileName":"Screen Shot 2017-11-18 at 7.09.23 AM.png","contentType":"image/png"}}}]}}},"pathname":"/portfolioEntry","query":{"portfolioEntry":"kebabtallrik-lund"},"buildId":"9363823d-5136-45df-a379-b30d24f5deaf","buildStats":{"app.js":{"hash":"7a632c223b1c2d89d9539440830399d4"}},"assetPrefix":"","nextExport":true,"err":null,"chunks":[]}
